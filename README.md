# File Organization

The bulk of the code in this project is within the src folder. In the src folder there is an app folder, assets folder, and environments folder. As a contributor, the app folder would be most useful. The app folder contains all the files for the quiz, result, and welcome pages which are the three main portions of the project.  Each quiz, results, and welcome folders consist of Angular (typescript), html, and css code that encompases the full stack web application

# Technologies - what they do and why they are used

### Angular
<a href="https://angular.io/tutorial" target="_blank">Angular Website</a>

Angular is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google, designed for building single-page applications (SPAs) with features like two-way data binding, component-based architecture, and robust tooling. It's suited for scalable, enterprise-level applications due to its modularity, TypeScript integration, and comprehensive solutions for common web development challenges. However, for smaller projects or simple websites, other frameworks or tools might be more appropriate.

### HTML and CSS
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML Website</a>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS Website</a>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of web pages, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) complements HTML by providing the means to style and layout web content, allowing designers to specify colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive designs. Together, HTML provides the foundational structure of a webpage, while CSS brings it to life with aesthetics and visual design.
